You can construct
new objects, put them on the workbench, invoke methods, and see the
return values, all without writing a line of code. You can download `BlueJ`` at no charge from
`www.bluej.org`. Another excellent environment
for interactively exploring objects is Dr. Java at
`drjava.sourceforge.net`.

Installed IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
